We're over 50% funded and we're getting close to the funding goal one DVD pledge at a time\n\nIt's not simply a DVD I'm releasing; it really is the start of a bigger brand which is to make Lovecraft films and make them right. Proper adaptations of the Old Gent's work done in the period and locales that he wrote the original tales are the goal and I truly believe that it's possible. I believe that audiences and fans of Lovecraft's work WANT to see faithful adaptations that respect the original material.\n\nMany of you know that filmmaking is never a guarantee. A thousand things can wrong on your journey to try and get a film done and quite often, the runner stumbles in that race to the finish line. It's a belief in yourself and your work that you really CAN get it done and that every speedbump is NOT a roadblock in your journey.\n\nSo, that's where I'm headed and I cannot thank all of you enough for cheering me on.

For some, every detail must be perfect to create the right illusion. But even if you are not good at sewing, there are many simple costumes you could make, because costuming is also about creating a visual idea. And as many already know, accessories make the outfit. Consider this:\n\nWhen dressing as Reba, carry a plush tiger.\n\nA bird's foot appetizer  (made of Styrofoam) and a mortified expression, makes any guy in a cheap suit look like Frederick Chilton.\n\nA plush pig and handfuls of Monopoly money lets everyone know you're Mason.\n\nNeed a prison onsie? They're cheap and easy to find at uniform shops.\n\nAnd dressing as Alana, consider a neck brace and cane as your accessories.\n\nTo add a touch of macabre to one of Bedelia's outfits, consider wrapping one leg in banana leaves.\n\nFor Abigail, carry a rough stitched pillow while wearing a bandage on your neck.\n\nSimple touches are enough sometimes to get across who you are in costume as.\n\nAnd costuming and flower crown making, as well as a costume contest, will be part of the Fannibal Fest convention schedule.",5,0,1683,SKYWATCH: a sci-fi short,104882,https://twitter.com/ColinLevy/status/839384216576086016,twitter,I'm up!

Great to see you all again.......  We're baackkkk on Kickstarter! =) *Ahem* We at Shadow Knights Studio operate as a professional business even though we are Indie and we value our reputation and take very seriously any attempts by others to try to tarnish our efforts and hard work we all have tirelessly put into our product. \n \nWith that said, as you may or may not know, we've been getting a lot of positive feedback and support for The Lighthouse game.  With the significant amount of attention we have drawn on this project, unfortunately sometimes comes the attempt by some to quell that momentum.  It is disappointing that some feel compelled to hold back the growth and success of the little guys [mostly girls here at Shadow Knights Studio], but we are a driven and relentless group not intimidated to face and overcome any obstacles thrown our way.  In the past week, we provided Kickstarter with the documentation to show we are in the right and overcame a claim that had caused our Kickstarter campaign being mistakenly frozen last Friday.  Today, Kickstarter has validated our position and our Kickstarter is back up! \n \nWhile Kickstarter has shared the good news with our backers, and even though we have prevailed, we do feel that our image may have been slightly tarnished as our momentum dropped and we lost backers as a result of the campaign being frozen.  We're not going to sugar coat it, this process has impacted our deadline to complete the game, our demo, and morale at the studio and we know that it will take time to make up for the lost time.  However, we want everyone to know that we are doing and will do whatever it takes to get back on the track we were on.  We will persevere and come out on top despite this hiccup!  Make no mistake, we're never going to stop and we will release The Lighthouse when it's done, rain or shine.\n \nWith that mumbo jumbo out of the way, we want to personally thank everyone who supported us while we dealt with this for the past week (trust us, it felt much longer).  Thanks to you and the personal messages of encouragement we received, we dusted our knees and focused on winning the battle we knew we were on the right side of.  We're glad we've made so many friends along the way, and are grateful to everyone for their support.  We are back up on Kickstarter and working harder than ever!  As always, we'll keep everyone updated on our progress because we have a lot to show! \n \nThank you everyone\n \nThe Shadow Knights Team\nLaylee Bodaghee\nDaniah Mandegary\nAri Bodaghee\n\nhttps://www.kickstarter.com/projects/shadowknightsstudio/the-lighthouse-thriller-game?ref=user_menu",2,0,1923,The Lighthouse (Thriller Game),126633,https://twitter.com/Shadow_Knights_/status/833853457618440193,twitter,RT @PlentyDreadful: _„ƒThe Lighthouse_„Ž Lights Up On Kickstarter - https://t.co/HgL1FazJ2f  #HorrorGame https://t.co/M8bJhodh0M,3,0,1923,The Lighthouse (Thriller Game),126682,https://twitter.com/Shadow_Knights_/status/825107631479984128,twitter,RT @LayleeJoy: The Lighthouse Alpha demo comes out tomorrow!
