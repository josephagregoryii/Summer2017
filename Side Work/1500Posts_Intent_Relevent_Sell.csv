It doesn't cost you anything to reblog/retweet my posts on Tumblr and Twitter, my username is Jaymzeecat on most social media. Share them on Facebook, you can get them directly from the Devil Spy Facebook page. Or make new posts of your own. If you know of anywhere else I should try posting, please let me know! If you're a fan of Devil Spy and you believe in this series, please tell people about it! If you have friends you think would like it, please spread the word! Sharing is IMMENSELY helpful!\n\nDRAW some fan art for Devil Spy! Fan art helps me show people that there is an interest in the comic! And it gives me something to post other than my monotonous Kickstarter posts! \n\nPLEDGE to the Kickstarter! Even if you don't want to buy the book right now, you can pledge just $1-$5. If everyone who subscribed to Devil Spy pledged just the cost of a cup of coffee, the book would already be funded! If you're planning to just buy the book later, please note that there wont be a book if the Kickstarter doesn't meet the funding goal in the next seven days. So please help me get the word out!\n\nThese are all things that would be incredibly helpful! Thank you so much!

We're trying to do several things. 10-12 song album (narrowed down from a large batch that we haven't even figured out yet). For just me to track the song you're looking at $500 a song. Just me. To make the songs beautiful, we add my friends. $50-200 more a song for each musician. No mastering, no nothing. Just a raw ass song. Then, we send said songs to mastering. Another $100-200 a song. Then there's actually printing the cd let alone a vinyl. Then there's merch. Tee's, tanks, koozies, stickers....Smallest batch $500.

So many angles, different ways people have found their lives inextricably linked to Elisa's.

With its capital in Beijing, the Ming Dynasty boasts one of the most organized governments and socially stable economies. An army of over a million troops makes the Ming Dynasty the most formidable force in the world. General Cheng, an accomplished voyager and military tactician, was sent by the Emperor to Atala to investigate the presence of ancient and very powerful relics called the Dragon Stones. Upon his failure to subdue the Atalians, Cheng called for massive reinforcements from Ming, but not before setting his eyes on the Empire of Azzaz after an apparent interference on their behalf.\n\nSupport on Kickstarter: http://kck.st/2dGXxel\nRead Chapter One FREE: http://bit.ly/malika-comic\n\nFun Fact: It is rumored that general ChengŠ—Ès forces total about 100,000, making it the largest Ming force ever assembled outside the empire itself.",1,1,1,184943,935,Remembering Rhinos,127611,https://twitter.com/MargotRaggett/status/840269332500402177,twitter,A few more pics from the presentation with @KP24 earlier.

All of the funds raised will go directly towards production and printing 50 books. \n\n5 books (10% of the total first editions) will be donated to willing and participating Melbourne and outer suburb Head space branches, for youths to flick through and hopefully benefit from knowing other people feel how they might be feeling, have faced similar struggles, that It can get better, You are not alone.\n\nPlease take a moment, have a read and a look, more updates, sneak peeks and videos will be uploaded to the official kick-starter funding page throughout this week and coming months in our last big stretch to reach our goal.\n\nThank you to everyone who has expressed interest, booked in, donated, shared their story or told their loved ones.\n\nWe still need 230 willing participants, sessions are only $10 - which can also be donated. For those of you wanting to contribute but not participate, donations help us to help someone else less fortunate to share their journey too.\n\nLet's do this together, we are on the home stretch of the funding and the beginning of the sessions, I encourage you all to be brave and step forward.

Sullivan teams up with Dabel Brothers Publishing, artists Max Raynor and Michael Bartolo, comic adaptation writer Derek Ruiz and letterer and production designer Dave Lanphear to bring Riyria to the graphic novel format for the first time. Sullivan's fantasy novel, The Death of Dulgath was Kickstarter's most successful fantasy novel project, and now it will be adapted into a two volume graphic novel series. The story will be lovingly interpreted in the visual form and supported by bonus material that is sure to excite any fan of fantasy who longs for that inside look into the making of the graphic novel.\n\nWithout such a generous fan base and the rampant support for the original novel of The Death Of Dulgath, the graphic novel would not be possible. We need your help again to propel Michael's work towards even further success. More than any other fantasy author today, Sullivan's extensive imagination merits a visual narrative.\n\n<3 Gladys #XOXOtheNerdGirl #NerdGirlOfficial #NerdGirlArmy #TeamDabel #IStreetTeam",2,1,1,1101756,1103,Dates!,139992,https://twitter.com/marginscomics/status/834629098458775553,twitter,"We just passed $6.3k and 28%, rounding out day 1 spectacularly.

Historically, I'm not the type that remembers my dreams, but this one felt strangely poignant to me. I don't remember much of it, but here's what I recall:\n\nSomeone (a face I didn't recognize) was crouched on the ground, wounded, dying in front of me. The figure started out as an animal (a deer, a horse maybe?), but then began to morph into the form and presence of a woman. I don't think it was my wife, because I couldn't nail down a distinct relationship with the creature, but I know in this dream, I loved her deeply. \n\nAnd it wasn't just romantic love that I felt for her. This love had movement. It transitioned from romantic love, to the love I feel for a friend, to the love I felt for my mother, to the love I feel for a stranger, to maybe even the love I feel for God. \n\nI was overcome with grief and sorrow and panic at the thought of losing her. I frantically began to weep and shout ""No, you can't leave yet! I haven't had enough time with you! I don't know how to live this life without you! Please stay!""\nAnd she looked me in the eyes, with all grace, compassion, empathy and transcendence and very calmly spoke,\n\n""Love is not about you. It is only the love you give and not the love you receive that matters.""\n\nThe moment she spoke those words, I became unattached to the thought of her dying or the fact that I would never see her again and felt a wave of overwhelming peace. I no longer felt like I would be empty or lost without her and I began to feel like I was a part of the greater whole.\n\nI abruptly awoke with tears in my eyes and a sense that I'd collected another puzzle piece to assist with this whole ""life"" thing and cuddled my hungry, unusually affectionate kitties, before getting up to feed them.\n\nNow, whether that dream has meaning or is just the result of watching too many Disney movies in my lifetime, I don't know...\n\nBut it does feel like a slightly more interesting prelude, to let you know that there are still 7 days left on my Kickstarter. \nThanks to YOU, the project has been fully funded! \nI'm now working on a stretch goal of $7,000 (currently at $6,600) in order to press some vinyl of my upcoming album Learned Behavior.\nBut I mostly just wanted to let you know, that there is still time to be a part of the pre-sale and grab some of the exclusive rewards that you'll only find on my Kickstarter.\nSo check it out, share it if you feel inclined and know that you guys have made me feel so loved and supported throughout this process! \nThank you!\n<3\n\nhttps://www.kickstarter.com/projects/844501634/aaron-lee-martin-new-album-learned-behavior?ref=creator_nav",1,0,1,179202,876,The Hues Volume III: EMBER,121727,https://www.facebook.com/alexheberlingproductions/posts/1488916214454033,facebook,Only a couple HOURS remain!,4,0,1,150638,511,River Series Triptychs & Tables,86056,https://www.facebook.com/KyleTGT/posts/1165166176927377,facebook,Looks like The River Series is over 90% funded on @Kickstarter!

Zack and his partner Stef rescued this little guy in Ecuador. Here is his story.\n\nDuring our trip to Ecuador, a man drew us a map on a napkin to navigate the way after the main road was washed out in a storm. Along the way, a dirty, shaggy, matted white dog with creepy white eyes started following us. Although we'd been wary of many dogs here, we gave this one a chance. He seemed keen on adventure apparently!\n\nWhat followed was an epic day. This alternate road was a journey up and down and up canyons mostly covered in sand too deep to bike on. Since we were going on what should have been a short ride, we didn't have much food for the poor guy for a while. \n\nWe finally made it to the famous Quilotoa Crater where we bought him a sausage he ate in one bite. The next day, we weren't surprised to find our new friend ready to hike with us. This time, we planned ahead and packed food for three.\n\nThe following day was time to say goodbye since we were going to take the highway for a bit. Our friend stayed in our mind for the rest of the journey. \nWeeks later, I rented a car and drove four hours back to Quilotoa. It was a long shot but I had to see if he was there. Fate had it that I found that same little white dog with light blue eyes in a village nearby.\n\nHe jumped in the car, off to a groomer. The result was the cutest little thing I have ever seen. Soon we were on our way to Victoria, Canada, the new home he has loved since then!\n\nAfter testing it was determined that Quito is 40% Poodle.",2,0,1,0141371,1718,The Shore,193000,https://www.facebook.com/theshore2017/posts/1599816226987532:0,facebook,"Thank you for your support, Maria Rodriguez!",2,0,1,0199632,1593,Without Disguise: starring David Ajala & Angela Sarafyan,266354,https://www.instagram.com/p/BQR3GxQA1sy/,instagram,#withoutdisguisefilm #director @mote_sinabel_aoki shoots #adcampaign for @costumenational #creativedirector @deborahfergusonstylist  #back our #shortfilm #withoutdisguisefilm #starring @davidajala and @angelasarafyan LINKTODONATE IN #bio,1,0,1,045382,442,Robyn,80753,https://twitter.com/bluefoxcomics/status/864873491690082304,twitter,I just backed That Girl Comic on @Kickstarter https://t.co/YhweOrkYVI,3,0,1,0181145,681,FannibalFest,244930,https://twitter.com/FannibalFest/status/826826881689350146,twitter,"Kiddos,\n\nVery thankful and appreciative to those that have backed us thus far.

The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks.\n\nI resisted the timer and the intervals for a long time, but FINALLY tested them...\n\nWhen I actually pressed the timer and started to work, #gamechanger.\n\nYour mind shifts to a different place as soon as you press go, and the next 25 minutes will be the most productive of your day, PERIOD.\n\nPersonally, I found 25 minutes were too short for my mindset, and through trial and error I found 42 minutes of FOCUS time, followed by 18 minutes of REFRESH time was my sweet spot.\n\nIt's important to note the REFRESH time is as critical as the FOCUS time. Don't skimp on either. I use my refresh time to meditate, journal, etc...\n\nWhen I started using The Pomodoro Technique daily, I realized it was going to be a KEY component of The Mastery Journal.\n\nWithin The Mastery Journal, there are FOUR daily sessions where The Pomodoro Technique is utilized.\n\nYou'll get more done in these four sessions than you used to get done all week.\n\nSo simple, yet SO effective.\n\nMy 1 challenge that will change your life?\n\nTry ONE Pomodoro session today...for 25 minutes and use this timer.\n\nReply back with your FOCUS task and your results.\n\nI can't WAIT for you to FEEL the difference!\n\nBelow is the latest update on The Mastery Journal campaign...\n\nIf you REALLY want to take this knowledge to the next level, head over to TheMasteryJournal.com. \nA special thanks to Jim Jackson of LoopBands for this gift, it arrived this morning!",1,1,1,0146774,1819,Butt Sniffin Pugs,198793,https://www.facebook.com/buttsniffinpugs/posts/947933745340584,facebook,It's true!
