THE VILLAIN VARIANT COVER!\n\nI know it's late in the game to add something like this, but when we had the idea for the cover concept, I couldn't help myself. I hired artist Marleni Gomez to illustrate a second cover to CLONSTERS, which we are calling our VILLAIN VARIANT.\n\nFeaturing the villains of CLONSTERS -- Gogo the feral Splat, and Jekka the Splat-hunting Nugget -- there will only be 100 copies printed.\n\nThe contents of the book are the exact same, with the only difference being this cover. This is a Kickstarter exclusive collector's item! I will be selling only the standard cover at conventions, so this will be pretty much the only place to get this version of the book.\n\nNow... there are three ways to get this:\n\n- VILLAIN VARIANT PLEDGE: I've added this to the rewards. For $40, you will get the villain variant plus the previous rewards like the stickers, coloring book prints, and the prints.\n\n- PLEDGES OVER $50: All pledges over $50 (before shipping) will get this FOR FREE. If you've already made those pledges, you're set!\n\n- ADDING $ TO MAKE $50: If you've pledged for a level that isn't higher than $50 but includes items that aren't available in higher level pledges (Destiny NY, Vampire Emmy) then contact me and I will help you manually add to your pledge so you can ALSO get this without losing the books you already have.\n\nWe have 53 hours to go and $949 left to raise!

THE VILLAIN VARIANT COVER!\n\nI know it's late in the game to add something like this, but when we had the idea for the cover concept, I couldn't help myself. I hired artist Marleni Teresa Gomez to illustrate a second cover to CLONSTERS, which we are calling our VILLAIN VARIANT.\n\nFeaturing the villains of CLONSTERS -- Gogo the feral Splat, and Jekka the Splat-hunting Nugget -- there will only be 100 copies printed.\n\nThe contents of the book are the exact same, with the only difference being this cover. This is a Kickstarter exclusive collector's item! I will be selling only the standard cover at conventions, so this will be pretty much the only place to get this version of the book.\n\nNow... there are three ways to get this:\n\n- VILLAIN VARIANT PLEDGE: I've added this to the rewards. For $40, you will get the villain variant plus the previous rewards like the stickers, coloring book prints, and the prints.\n\n- PLEDGES OVER $50: All pledges over $50 (before shipping) will get this FOR FREE. If you've already made those pledges, you're set!\n\n- ADDING $ TO MAKE $50: If you've pledged for a level that isn't higher than $50 but includes items that aren't available in higher level pledges (Destiny NY, Vampire Emmy) then contact me and I will help you manually add to your pledge so you can ALSO get this without losing the books you already have.\n\nWe have 53 hours to go and $949 left to raise!

1. CLONSTERS is a full-color graphic novel that I wrote with my fiancÈe Amy Granfors. By the time itís published later this year, sheíll be Amy Shand. WE ARE SUPER EXCITED ABOUT THAT.

2. We like to pitch it as ìADVENTURE TIME meets AAAHH! REAL MONSTERS.î It marries the subversive weirdness of nineties cartoons with the enthusiastic adventures of modern animation. Itís an all-ages comic that kids AND adults can love.

3. We are raising the money to publish it on Kickstarter. Kickstarter is an all-or-nothing platform. If we raise $8500 or more, CLONSTERS will be published. If we donít make goal, you will NOT be charged.

4. CLONSTERS is illustrated by Vanessa Cardinali, whose beautiful artwork you can see below.

5. We have ten days left and a little over $5000 to raise. That's a lot.

So many say they want to back the project, and that is encouraging... I hope they do.  \nI wanted to share a couple of quick stories.  Do you guys remember the Windmill Lane watchers?  I remember hearing about them, but never met any.  It was a group of  mostly young teens that used to hang out at Windmill Lane Studios in the 1980s, they would help share what the band was up to.  And they all had some pretty incredible experiences.  Well one of them reached out to me and shared a bit of her story.  She said that the entire band would come and talk with them, but particularly Bono... he showed a lot of interest in them, and was like a big brother to them.  Thats an incredible story, what a connection, and moments like that need to be put to film, it really is almost music history they were a part of.  Please help us do that by backing the campaign. You can find it by clicking the link in my signature.\n\nAnother story... anyone remember The Bank Robbers?  They got to get up on stage with the band on the Vertigo Tour in NJ.  I was next to them talking to Bono when they gave them a CD of them doing a punk cover of Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For.  Bono said he would listen, and he told them to stand at a specific spot on the floor, and watch for his guy.  Nobody thought he would actually do anything... but then he did.. he went and found the bank robbers and pulled them on stage and let them lead a ruff, but fun version of Still Havent Found.  I saw it all unfold, it was amazing.  Well the Bank Robbers got in touch with me yesterday too.  Another great story, and there are so many more... please help me tell them.\n#DreamOutLoudFIlm #U2FanFilm #U2 #DreamOutLoud",1,1,
